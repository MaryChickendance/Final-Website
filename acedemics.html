    	<p class="writing">My biggest academic accomplishment of this
year, the iSearch project, took almost three
months, and I am super happy with how far
Iâ€™ve come. I am writing about a topic I am
super passionate about: The intersection of
Sexism and clothing.</p>

		<p class="writing" class ="responsive">I joined the mock trial team this year, and was
assigned to be an attorney my very first year.
It was a huge learning experience for me, and
I really enjoyed it. This year, our team placed
third in the country, but we lost to the team
that ended up being seventh in the state.
Next year, I will be a part of the leadership
team for Mock Trial, and I cannot wait to see
where it will go.</p>

		<p class="writing">At the end of my eighth grade year, My whole
grade, including me, wrote a 3-act musical,
including song and dances, and filmed it into
a movie. I wrote one of the scenes with my
teammates, and performed as the main role
in our scene, as well as in a dance. It was a
really cool experience, and I learned a lot
about theater in the process.</p>

<p class="writing">In both 6th and 8th grade I competed for my
school in the CETA california theater festival,
where I won 3 gold and 1 bronze medals. I
won gold both years for my duets, and a gold
for a scene I did with my friend. I won bronze
for a monologue my sixth grade year.</p>

<p class="writing">And finally, this website! In my joy of comupting class we are making html and css websites from scratch. Learning and writing all this code, and fiddling around with my design, has been one of my favorite units of this class so far in the year. I am excited to see how I can apply HTML to my life as I get over, maybe using it to start a website or blog to document my outfits, or having this knowledge in working with apps I need to use when I'm older.</p>
