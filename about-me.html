        <p class="writing">Hi. My name Mary Schickedanz and I am a Freshman at Piedmont High School. I live with my mom, my dad, my twin sister, and my little sister, as well as my 2 cats and dog. I play lacrosse and am learning to plaly waterpolo in high school. I am passionate about my acedemics and value doing well in school, but love having time to do activities i enjoy. I love listening to music whenever I can, and love any indie-related genre.</p>
        <p class="writing">In my free time I love to read, draw, act, and most importantly, spend time with my friends. I love playing sports for my high school as well as pursuing acting and participating in mock trial, where I will be a leader of the team sophmore year. I also love travelling and trying new food wherever I go.</p>
    	<p class="writing">fashion is a huge passion of mine, and I love looking through Vogue and keeping up with designers and influncer trends through social media. I hope to go into either fashion journalism or law when I am older, but want to keep my options open, because I still have a long way to go before I need to decide where I want to work</p>
        <p class="writing"> I am very passionate about women's rights as well, and could talk to anyone for hours about the topic.</p>
